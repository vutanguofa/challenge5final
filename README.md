# challenge5final

## Description

This is a simple work day calendar that allows you to add tasks to your daily schedule. It's color coded in that the task blocks will turn red if the task is from the past, yellow for current tasks, and green for upcoming/future tasks. Adding and saving the tasks will store the details in the local storage and the details will still be displayed if the site is closed and then revisited later. The current date and time is also included at the top to illustrate the time and day.
